Welcome to the VASP_DOS program.
It converts DOSCAR files of a VASP density of state calculation to an easily plottable form.
You can plot DOS Vs Energy using gnuplot, python, xmgrace etc.

1. I need 1.POSCAR   2.OUTCAR(with correct E-fermi)   3.DOSCAR
2. It resolves the DOS by element, atom, spin polarization and orbitals all in one go.
3. The first column is the energy and other columns are density of states.
4. The sequence of the orbital resolved columns is same as that given in VASP website (https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/DOSCAR):
   energy  s  p_y p_z p_x d_{xy} d_{yz} d_{z2-r2} d_{xz} d_{x2-y2}
5. a) For ISPIN = 1 nonmagnetic calculation run : dos_DOSCAR_nonmag1.sh
   b) For ISPIN = 2 Spin-Polarized, Collinear calculation run : dos_DOSCAR_nonsoc4.sh. 
      This will generate UP and Down Spin polarized density files separately.
   c) For Noncollinear calculation run : dos_DOSCAR_soc.sh.
      This will generate total density (including all directions of spin), MX, MY and MZ polarized density files separately.
